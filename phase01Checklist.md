## Troubleshooting

### If Railway deployment fails:
1. Check Railway → Deployments → Build Logs for errors
2. Verify `requirements.txt` includes all dependencies
3. Verify `runtime.txt` specifies Python version (e.g., `python-3.11.0`)
4. Check that `Procfile` or Railway start command is correct: `gunicorn app:app`
5. Verify environment variables are set correctly (no quotes needed in Railway)

### If SendGrid email fails:
1. Check Railway environment variables: `SENDGRID_API_KEY` and `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL`
2. Verify sender email is verified in SendGrid dashboard
3. Check SendGrid Activity dashboard for error details
4. Look in spam folder
5. Check Railway logs for SendGrid API errors

### If Twilio SMS fails:
1. Check Railway environment variables: `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`
2. Verify phone number format: +11234567890 (must include +1)
3. Confirm you have trial credit or paid balance in Twilio
4. Check Twilio console logs for error details
5. Check Railway logs for Twilio API errors

### If database errors occur:
1. Verify PostgreSQL is provisioned in Railway project
2. Check Railway logs for database connection errors
3. Verify `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set (automatic)
4. In Railway → PostgreSQL → Data tab, verify tables exist
5. Redeploy to trigger database initialization

### If CSV import fails:
1. Verify CSV has `email` column (case-sensitive)
2. Phone column is optional but must be formatted correctly
3. Check CSV is properly formatted (comma-separated)
4. Check Railway logs for specific error message
5. Test with `test_contacts.csv` first

### If SMS opt-out webhook doesn't work:
1. Verify Twilio webhook URL is set correctly: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/sms-optout`
2. Verify webhook method is POST
3. Check Railway logs when you send STOP - should see webhook hit
4. Verify contact phone number matches in database
5. Test webhook manually: `curl -X POST https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/sms-optout -d "From=+11234567890&Body=STOP"`

### Viewing Railway Logs:
1. Railway dashboard → Your project
2. Click on "Deployments" tab
3. Click on latest deployment
4. View "Deploy Logs" (build time) or "View Logs" (runtime)
5. Use logs to debug API errors, database issues, etc.

### Checking Database Contents:
**Option 1: Railway PostgreSQL Data Tab**
1. Railway → PostgreSQL service → Data tab
2. Run SQL queries directly: `SELECT * FROM customers;`

**Option 2: Connect via psql**
1. Railway → PostgreSQL → Connect
2. Copy connection command
3. Run in terminal to access database
