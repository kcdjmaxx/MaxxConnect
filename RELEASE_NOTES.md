## What's New in 3.0.0

### QR Code Redemption System

Complete system for staff to validate and redeem customer QR codes via mobile-friendly web interface.

#### Staff Scanner PWA (`/staff/redeem`)

- **Camera QR Scanning**: Uses jsQR library for real-time QR code detection
- **Manual Entry Fallback**: Enter tokens manually when camera unavailable
- **Audio Feedback**: Web Audio API generates tones (ascending for success, descending for error)
- **Voice Feedback**: Web Speech API announces results ("Valid code for John", "Success!")
- **Visual Feedback**: Large green (VALID) or red (INVALID) display
- **iOS Home Screen Support**: PWA meta tags allow "Add to Home Screen" for standalone app experience
- **Dark Theme**: Optimized for scanning in various lighting conditions
- **No Navigation Bar**: Clean, focused interface with simple "Back" button

#### Public Landing Page (`/redeem/<token>`)

- Shows QR code validity status to customers
- Displays customer name and campaign info
- Instructs customer to show screen to staff for redemption

#### Redemption Analytics (`/analytics/redemptions`)

- **Overall Stats**: Total QR codes, redeemed codes, redemption rate
- **Per-Campaign Stats**: Breakdown by campaign with individual rates
- **Hourly Distribution Chart**: Visual chart of redemptions by hour (last 30 days)
- **Recent Redemptions Table**: Live feed of recent redemption events
